                <p>I am a true island boy. We naturally tend to be warm and hospitable people
                who like meeting fellow natives and visitors to our country. This is the reason
                I also want to break into tech and land a remote job so that I can start to travel
                and meet more people and do way more site-seeing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
               <p><span>My passion:</span> I love soccer and I used to be quite the player back in my more youthful
                years. I still play but now I am just happy to still get the chance to represent. I am
                also a lover of music, good books and great food. Now because of my tech interest
                I am trying to spark something in myself for coding because I am totally invested in this.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
               <p><span>A fun fact:</span> My first and last names are four letters long. I was born on the fourth
                month of the year and I always wear the number four jersey for my soccer teams. I was
                told a long time ago that the number four is a powerful number and I guess I am definitely
                starting to believe it.</p>
